"It is important to know the following guidelines for handling disclosures of abuse, neglect, and violence from participants:\n"
"\n"
"1️⃣ **Understand abuse, neglect and exploitation.**\n"
"\n"
"❗ **Abuse** refers to a deliberate act of maltreatment that can damage a boy or girl’s security, wellbeing, dignity and development. Abuse includes all forms of physical, sexual, psychological and emotional maltreatment. (Save the Children definition)\n"
"\n"
"❗ **Violence** against girls and boys is defined as forms of physical or mental violence, damage and abuse, neglect or neglectful treatment or maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse. (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 1990,\n"
"Article 19)\n"
"\n"
"❗ **Child exploitation** refers to using girls and boys for economic or sexual benefit, gratification or profit, often resulting in unjust, cruel and harmful treatment of the girl or boy. (Save the Children definition)\n"
"\n"
"2️⃣ **Know your organisation’s child safeguarding policies and referral procedures.**\n"
"\n"
"📖 All organisations should have or develop child rights safeguarding policies and referral procedures, including details on how to respond appropriately when a caregiver, other adults, girl or boy discloses abuse. \n"
"\n"
"📝 You should have accurate knowledge of all protocols and response plans. These will tell you what to do within your organisation if a caregiver or girl or boy reports abuse (e.g. who to report to, internal resources for supporting the girl or boy), as well as how to engage outside resources (e.g. local referral pathways, when to engage with authorities). \n"
"\n"
"🔑 It is your responsibility to act regardless of whether you are responding to disclosures of past and/or present abuse. However, you are not responsible for resolving the situation on your own. It is important that you discuss the situation with your supervisor to agree on what steps to take next.\n"
"\n"
"3️⃣ **Ensure parents know that you are someone who can help.**\n"
"\n"
"🌷Parents participating in your sessions need to know that they can come to you for help, regardless of when the abuse occurred. \n"
"\n"
"👂You should make sure that they know that they can trust you and that you will listen and support them without judgement or any further harm."

"👂 Listen carefully to the participant and take notes: what/when/where/who.\n"
"\n"
"❗ Determine if the participant is in immediate danger and what help is available.\n"
"\n"
"💙 Make sure that the participant feels that you believe him/her.\n"
"\n"
"🌷 Let them know they have done the right thing by sharing their story with you.\n"
"\n"
"✨ Be supportive and free of judgement in your responses – avoid blaming at all times!\n"
"\n"
"➡️ Let the participant know that you will share what he/she told you with your supervisor to find a way to support and protect him/her.\n"
"\n"
"📝 Explain what you are going to do next.\n"
"\n"
" ✅ Notify @global.supervisor_name\n"
