"It is important to know the following guidelines for handling disclosures of abuse, neglect, and violence from participants:\n"

"1Ô∏è‚É£ **Understand abuse, neglect and exploitation.**\n"

"‚ùó **Abuse** refers to a deliberate act of maltreatment that can damage a boy or girl‚Äôs security, wellbeing, dignity and development. Abuse includes all forms of physical, sexual, psychological and emotional maltreatment. (Save the Children definition)\n"
"\n"
"‚ùó **Violence** against girls and boys is defined as forms of physical or mental violence, damage and abuse, neglect or neglectful treatment or maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse. (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 1990,\n"

"\n"
"üìù You should have accurate knowledge of all protocols and response plans. These will tell you what to do within your organisation if a caregiver or girl or boy reports abuse (e.g. who to report to, internal resources for supporting the girl or boy), as well as how to engage outside resources (e.g. local referral pathways, when to engage with authorities). \n"
"\n"
"üîë It is your responsibility to act regardless of whether you are responding to disclosures of past and/or present abuse. However, you are not responsible for resolving the situation on your own.
