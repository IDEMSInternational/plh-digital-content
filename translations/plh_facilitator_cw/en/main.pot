"@global.prog_name is part of a larger initiative called Parenting for Lifelong Health (PLH). \n"
"\n"
"PLH’s objective is to develop and test a suite of effective, feasible, culturally relevant, and scalable parenting programmes to reduce the risk of violence against children and improve child wellbeing in low- and middle-income countries. \n"
"\n"
"At present, there are few parenting programmes to prevent child maltreatment for children ranging from 0 to 18 years in low- and middle-income countries (where the need is greatest) that are both evidence-based and affordable. \n"
"\n"
"Parenting for Lifelong Health aims to fill this gap.\n"
"\n"
"Parenting programmes that strengthen families through the development and reinforcement of positive parenting practices and enhancement of positive parent-child relationships are an effective way to reduce the risk of child maltreatment and other forms of violence against children. \n"
"\n"
"These programmes promote parenting practices and behaviours that build the skills of parents or caregivers to interact positively and provide adequate support and care to their children. Parenting programmes have been also shown to be effective at preventing and treating disruptive behaviour amongst children and reducing maternal mental health problems. \n"
"\n"
"Although there is a large body of evidence on the effectiveness of parenting programmes in high-income countries, there are currently very few evidence-based interventions that are well-suited for the cultural and developmental contexts of low- and middle-income countries. There may also be limitations to transporting evidence-based parenting programmes developed in high-income countries to low resource settings due to cost, licensing, and cultural relevance.   \n"
"\n"
"To respond to this need for locally adapted, affordable, and scalable parenting programmes in low-income settings, the Parenting for Lifelong Health developed  programmes specifically for families with young children – PLH for Young Children – and for those with adolescents – PLH for Teens. \n"
"\n"
"These programmes are based on over 50 years of research and practice and are grounded in social learning principles and applied behaviour analysis. \n"
"\n"
"Initially developed and tested in South Africa, PLH has been adapted for other countries and has now been implemented all over the world in more than 25 different countries by facilitators just like you."

"The key approach to @global.prog_name is that we draw on the shared wisdom and experience of our parents to help brainstorm and problem-solve the challenges we want to tackle at home. That means that we want everybody to pool their ideas so that we all develop and practice new skills. \n"
"\n"
"Parents are welcome to share in whatever way they are most comfortable: text or audio messages. \n"
"\n"
"The foundation for this programme is the idea that parents want to strengthen their relationships with their kids in order to build a healthy home. That’s why they are here! \n"
"\n"
"The programme encourages positive interactions between parents and kids by helping parents to develop skills around praising good behaviour, spending quality time, and talking about feelings. \n"
"\n"
"If parents are spending time reinforcing positive behaviours with praise, then parents will have to do less work managing problem behaviours. \n"
"\n"
"Other skills that the programme introduces to manage unwanted behaviours include ignoring and redirecting negative attention-seeking behaviours and introducing consequences. \n"
"\n"
"The notion that children are kept safe by establishing rules and routines, planning for any risks, and surrounding them with as much care as possible underscores the entire programme.\n"
"\n"
"The programme uses online messaging platforms that are familiar to parents (e.g., WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, etc.). \n"
"\n"
"The main teaching method in this programme is to do activities together to enable learning through doing instead of learning through being told. This method helps participants to learn both during the sessions and at home. \n"

"It is important to know the following guidelines for handling disclosures of abuse, neglect, and violence from participants:\n"
"\n"
"1️⃣ **Understand abuse, neglect and exploitation.**\n"
"\n"
"❗ **Abuse** refers to a deliberate act of maltreatment that can damage a boy or girl’s security, wellbeing, dignity and development. Abuse includes all forms of physical, sexual, psychological and emotional maltreatment. (Save the Children definition)\n"
"\n"
"❗ **Violence** against girls and boys is defined as forms of physical or mental violence, damage and abuse, neglect or neglectful treatment or maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse. (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 1990,\n"
"Article 19)\n"
"\n"
"❗ **Child exploitation** refers to using girls and boys for economic or sexual benefit, gratification or profit, often resulting in unjust, cruel and harmful treatment of the girl or boy. (Save the Children definition)\n"
"\n"
"2️⃣ **Know your organisation’s child safeguarding policies and referral procedures.**\n"
"\n"
"📖 All organisations should have or develop child rights safeguarding policies and referral procedures, including details on how to respond appropriately when a caregiver, other adults, girl or boy discloses abuse. \n"
"\n"
"📝 You should have accurate knowledge of all protocols and response plans. These will tell you what to do within your organisation if a caregiver or girl or boy reports abuse (e.g. who to report to, internal resources for supporting the girl or boy), as well as how to engage outside resources (e.g. local referral pathways, when to engage with authorities). \n"
"\n"

"**Ways in which facilitators can make @global.prog_name group sessions a happy place to learn:**\n"
"\n"
"Respect whatever a participant talks about. Facilitators should be aware and respectful of different ages, genders, values, and circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"Model the behaviour you want from the participants. The group space should be a judgement-free space in which participants feel comfortable sharing sensitive material.\n"
"\n"
"Notice and reflect the ways that participants communicate, help each other, and participate in the sessions.\n"
"\n"
"Invite participation: If you feel a participant is holding back or quiet, ask if he or she wishes to share an opinion or experience.\n"
"\n"
"Make sure that everyone in the group is communicating clearly.\n"
"\n"
"Create a comfortable and welcoming place to meet. Make sure everyone knows how to log-into and interact with the group through the messaging platform you are using.\n"
"\n"
"Establish the communication needs of the participants – are participants using audio? Video?\n"
"\n"
"Notice if participants have challenges that may require adjusting the way they participate in activities.\n"
"\n"
"Praise participants for their effort and dedication.\n"
"\n"
"Model the behaviour you want from the parents in the way that you treat them. \n"
"\n"
"Praise, respect, and reflect on participants’ contributions."
