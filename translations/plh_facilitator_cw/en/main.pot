"In this first module it’s important to create a welcoming space for everyone. \n"
"\n"
"Ground rules should be developed at the beginning of the programme and owned by the group – so everybody should agree. \n"
"- Try to help parents make specific rules. \n"
"- Make sure everybody in the group understands each rule and what is required of the group.\n"
"- Help parents to make positive rules! Instead of ‘no criticising’ try ‘provide supportive feedback’.\n"
"- Give parents a chance to debate the rules that are being suggested. This will help everyone to own the final set of rules. \n"
"- Praise suggestions!\n"
"\n"
"**Praise & confidence building**: Remember that just like speaking up in a group for the first time, parents might be feeling nervous. Give parents as much positive reinforcement and thanks for sharing as you can on day one. \n"
"\n"
"**Normalising difficult households**: Make sure you remind parents that no household is perfect! We all have problems and challenges – praise parents regularly for being here because they want to put in the work to change something for the better. \n"
"\n"
"**Confidentiality:** This means that what gets said or circulated in the group, stays in the group! It’s important to be clear right at the beginning what is okay to share with others outside the group and what is not. In order for people to feel comfortable enough to participate, they need to know that they can trust the group with the stories they are sharing – and that these will not be shared outside of the group. Sharing new positive information is absolutely fine, though! \n"
"\n"
"If there is a need to break confidentiality, it is because a parent has disclosed or has shown evidence or significant risk of harm to themselves or their children (physical, emotional, or physical). The facilitator needs to break confidentiality if there is a risk of self-harm or harm to others. When this happens, the facilitator will ensure that they communicate directly in private with the person in question."

"The key approach to @global.prog_name is that we draw on the shared wisdom and experience of our parents to help brainstorm and problem-solve the challenges we want to tackle at home. That means that we want everybody to pool their ideas so that we all develop and practice new skills. \n"
"\n"
"Parents are welcome to share in whatever way they are most comfortable: text or audio messages. \n"
"\n"
"The foundation for this programme is the idea that parents want to strengthen their relationships with their kids in order to build a healthy home. That’s why they are here! \n"
"\n"
"The programme encourages positive interactions between parents and kids by helping parents to develop skills around praising good behaviour, spending quality time, and talking about feelings. \n"
"\n"
"If parents are spending time reinforcing positive behaviours with praise, then parents will have to do less work managing problem behaviours. \n"
"\n"
"Other skills that the programme introduces to manage unwanted behaviours include ignoring and redirecting negative attention-seeking behaviours and introducing consequences. \n"
"\n"
"The notion that children are kept safe by establishing rules and routines, planning for any risks, and surrounding them with as much care as possible underscores the entire programme.\n"
"\n"
"The programme uses online messaging platforms that are familiar to parents (e.g., WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, etc.). \n"

"The main teaching method in this programme is to do activities together to enable learning through doing instead of learning through being told. This method helps participants to learn both during the sessions and at home. \n"

"It is important to know the following guidelines for handling disclosures of abuse, neglect, and violence from participants:\n"
"\n"
"1️⃣ **Understand abuse, neglect and exploitation.**\n"
"\n"
"❗ **Abuse** refers to a deliberate act of maltreatment that can damage a boy or girl’s security, wellbeing, dignity and development. Abuse includes all forms of physical, sexual, psychological and emotional maltreatment. (Save the Children definition)\n"

"\n"
"❗ **Child exploitation** refers to using girls and boys for economic or sexual benefit, gratification or profit, often resulting in unjust, cruel and harmful treatment of the girl or boy. (Save the Children definition)\n"

"2️⃣ **Know your organisation’s child safeguarding policies and referral procedures.**\n"
"\n"
"📖 All organisations should have or develop child rights safeguarding policies and referral procedures, including details on how to respond appropriately when a caregiver, other adults, girl or boy discloses abuse. \n"

"📝 You should have accurate knowledge of all protocols and response plans. These will tell you what to do within your organisation if a caregiver or girl or boy reports abuse (e.g. who to report to, internal resources for supporting the girl or boy), as well as how to engage outside resources (e.g. local referral pathways, when to engage with authorities). \n"
"\n"

"Happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, surprise, and fear: We all experience emotions. Because emotions are connected to our thoughts and behaviour, they play an important role in how we make decisions. If we don’t handle emotions well, we risk making bad decisions that can affect our well-being. And when we learn how to handle our emotions, we are more likely to be able to make clear decisions and act in a responsive and nurturing way towards our children, other adults, and ourselves.\n"
"\n"
"Young people who don’t manage their emotions can resort to risky behaviours that can be dangerous for them. It is important for parents to learn to help their children to recognise and manage their strong emotions. \n"
"\n"
"Talking about difficult emotions is especially important. Difficult emotions like anger can become stressful thoughts and uncontrolled behaviours. Before we can talk about the emotions we are experiencing, just being aware of them can help us to stay present in a moment, which will allow the feelings to run their course and pass. This is also true for children.\n"
"\n"
"When parents name their children’s feelings, or comment on them, it helps children to develop a sense of emotional control.

"The objective of this week is to learn how parents can be more effective at getting their children to follow their instructions. They do this in two ways: \n"
"\n"
"1️⃣ Giving specific, positive, and realistic instructions\n"
"2️⃣ Praising their children for following instructions and at other times\n"
"\n"
"When parents give specific, positive, and realistic instructions, children know exactly what behaviour is expected from them. \n"
"\n"
"For example, “Please put your toys away in the box.” This tells the child exactly what to do by describing the behaviour that is expected. It also considers the capabilities of the child so that the instruction is realistic. \n"
"\n"
"Compare this to, “Don’t make a mess,” which does not describe the behaviour that a parent would want to see, is not specific, and might not be realistic if the child is not capable of keeping tidy. \n"
"\n"
"Children also have challenges following many instructions at one time – especially younger children. They are much better at following instructions if they are given one at a time.  Parents can pause for a bit to give children time to follow each instruction before moving to the next one. It may take more time, but this supports children to follow instructions and to remember the task.  \n"
"\n"
"Each child has their own unique characteristics and capabilities. It is important that parents know what is realistic for their children to do when giving them instructions. For instance, it is very hard for children to keep quiet for a whole day but maybe they can keep quiet for 15 minutes while their parents take a call.  \n"
"\n"
"Children also hear better and understand the instructions clearly when parents speak in a calm voice. Yelling at children only increases the tension for everyone. Children are also more likely to follow instructions in a calm way.\n"
"\n"
"Praise is an expression of approval or appreciation. When parents praise their children for following instructions, they are encouraging that behaviour to happen more often. The same works for praising other behaviours. Also, behaviour that is ignored is less likely to happen again. \n"
"\n"
"With the example above, a parent could say, “Thank you for putting your toys in the box, Joseph,” after he follows the instruction. This will encourage Joseph to continue cleaning up his toys in the future. It also maintains a positive feeling between the parent and Joseph."

"There are lots of different ways for parents to encourage their children to behave well. In this programme we have already looked at one of these ways: praising the behaviour we would like to see more of. \n"
"\n"
"In this module we look at two other strategies for managing child behaviours: Redirecting and consequences. \n"
"\n"
"Redirecting is a strategy that is especially effective with younger children. When parents redirect their children from a negative behaviour to a positive behaviour at the beginning of the behaviour, they reduce the chance that the negative behaviour happens or grows into something more difficult to manage. This works especially well if parents then praise their children for the positive behaviour they end up doing. \n"
"\n"
"Consequences are the results of actions or behaviours. For example, not cleaning the dishes will result in not having a clean plate to eat from. Parents can use planned consequences with their children and teens when they forget or do not follow household rules. For example, if there is a household rule to come home before sunset and a child comes home late when out playing with friends, then an appropriate consequence could be that they cannot play with friends the next day.\n"
"\n"
"Parents can involve their children and teens in planning consequences for certain behaviours. For example, they could discuss with their children what a consequence could be if they do not follow a certain household rule when they are creating it with them. \n"
"\n"
"Consequences can also be used when a child refuses to follow an instruction. Parents should first give a child a choice, for example, “Either you clear the table, or you will not be able to watch your favourite T.V. show.” This gives them a chance to comply and avoid receiving the consequence.\n"
"It is also important that parents make sure their consequences are reasonable and that they can follow through with them. Banning T.V. for the rest of the year or threatening to sell it is not something that parents can realistically do. It is also unfair!\n"
"\n"
"We call strategies like redirect and consequences ‘positive discipline’ because they reinforce the positive relationship that parents are actively trying to build with their children by spending time together, praising and setting clear boundaries with rules."

"2️⃣ Be Fair. Give your child a choice to comply before giving a consequence. For household rules, you can discuss consequences with your child or teen in advance. Make sure the consequence is reasonable and one you can follow through on.\n"

"3️⃣ Be Positive. Remember the Sunshine of Positive Attention!

"The last module of the @global.app_name programme is about reflection and sharing. This final module is a bit longer than normal as you will help parents to reflect on their experiences during the programme and make specific plans on how they want to go forward without your facilitation.\n"
"\n"
"The module starts with an opportunity to learn one final parenting skill – involving your children in solving problems. Throughout the entire programme, you have been modelling the key steps of solving problems with the parents.\n"

"1️⃣ Identify the problem\n"
"2️⃣ Jointly come up with solutions\n"
"3️⃣ Choose a solution\n"
"4️⃣ Try the solution out\n"
"5️⃣ Reflect on whether the solution worked\n"
"\n"
"Each week during the discussion on home activities and illustrated stories, the parents have used the same steps in problem solving to help identify and practice solutions to challenges experienced.\n"
"\n"
"Teaching children how to solve their own problems is a skill that children will take with them for the rest of their lives. What a gift!\n"
"\n"
"In the second part of the module, parents have the opportunity to reflect on the changes they have seen in their families and the experiences that they have had during the programme. They can share how they have changed and what they have noticed about how their children’s behaviours may have changed.\n"
"\n"
"This is also an opportunity to discuss how parents can continue using the skills and building blocks they have practiced over the course of the programme. Weekly chats have enabled parents to get to know each other and to support each other. That support doesn’t need to end! With a new administrator of the group, the chat group can be used whenever anybody needs to reach out or check-in. \n"
