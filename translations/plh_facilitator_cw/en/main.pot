"@global.prog_name was developed by the Ministry of Social Development, Labour, and Welfare, UNICEF the Netherlands, Parenting for Lifelong Health, in partnership with the Parenting Commission in Curaçao.\n"

"\n"
"@global.prog_name is part of a larger initiative called Parenting for Lifelong Health (PLH). \n"
"\n"
"PLH’s objective is to develop and test a suite of effective, feasible, culturally relevant, and scalable parenting programmes to reduce the risk of violence against children and improve child wellbeing in low- and middle-income countries. \n"
"\n"
"At present, there are few parenting programmes to prevent child maltreatment for children ranging from 0 to 18 years in low- and middle-income countries (where the need is greatest) that are both evidence-based and affordable. \n"
"\n"
"Parenting for Lifelong Health aims to fill this gap.\n"
"\n"
"Parenting programmes that strengthen families through the development and reinforcement of positive parenting practices and enhancement of positive parent-child relationships are an effective way to reduce the risk of child maltreatment and other forms of violence against children. \n"
"\n"
"These programmes promote parenting practices and behaviours that build the skills of parents or caregivers to interact positively and provide adequate support and care to their children. Parenting programmes have been also shown to be effective at preventing and treating disruptive behaviour amongst children and reducing maternal mental health problems. \n"
"\n"
"Although there is a large body of evidence on the effectiveness of parenting programmes in high-income countries, there are currently very few evidence-based interventions that are well-suited for the cultural and developmental contexts of low- and middle-income countries. There may also be limitations to transporting evidence-based parenting programmes developed in high-income countries to low resource settings due to cost, licensing, and cultural relevance.   \n"
"\n"
"To respond to this need for locally adapted, affordable, and scalable parenting programmes in low-income settings, the Parenting for Lifelong Health developed  programmes specifically for families with young children – PLH for Young Children – and for those with adolescents – PLH for Teens. \n"
"\n"
"These programmes are based on over 50 years of research and practice and are grounded in social learning principles and applied behaviour analysis. \n"
"\n"
"Initially developed and tested in South Africa, PLH has been adapted for other countries and has now been implemented all over the world in more than 25 different countries by facilitators just like you."

"- Facilitators and participants working to solve problems together\n"
"- Activities for participants to engage with \n"
"- Practicing the things we’ve learnt when we go home\n"

"The key approach to @global.prog_name is that we draw on the shared wisdom and experience of our parents to help brainstorm and problem-solve the challenges we want to tackle at home. That means that we want everybody to pool their ideas so that we all develop and practice new skills. \n"
"\n"
"Parents are welcome to share in whatever way they are most comfortable: text or audio messages. \n"
"\n"
"The foundation for this programme is the idea that parents want to strengthen their relationships with their kids in order to build a healthy home. That’s why they are here! \n"
"\n"
"The programme encourages positive interactions between parents and kids by helping parents to develop skills around praising good behaviour, spending quality time, and talking about feelings. \n"
"\n"
"If parents are spending time reinforcing positive behaviours with praise, then parents will have to do less work managing problem behaviours. \n"
"\n"
"Other skills that the programme introduces to manage unwanted behaviours include ignoring and redirecting negative attention-seeking behaviours and introducing consequences. \n"
"\n"
"The notion that children are kept safe by establishing rules and routines, planning for any risks, and surrounding them with as much care as possible underscores the entire programme.\n"
"\n"
"The programme uses online messaging platforms that are familiar to parents (e.g., WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, etc.). \n"
"\n"
"The main teaching method in this programme is to do activities together to enable learning through doing instead of learning through being told. This method helps participants to learn both during the sessions and at home. \n"
"\n"
"This is because we all remember and understand things much better when we have done them ourselves."

"It is important to know the following guidelines for handling disclosures of abuse, neglect, and violence from participants:\n"
"\n"
"1️⃣ **Understand abuse, neglect and exploitation.**\n"
"\n"
"❗ **Abuse** refers to a deliberate act of maltreatment that can damage a boy or girl’s security, wellbeing, dignity and development. Abuse includes all forms of physical, sexual, psychological and emotional maltreatment. (Save the Children definition)\n"
"\n"
"❗ **Violence** against girls and boys is defined as forms of physical or mental violence, damage and abuse, neglect or neglectful treatment or maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse. (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 1990,\n"
"Article 19)\n"
"\n"
"❗ **Child exploitation** refers to using girls and boys for economic or sexual benefit, gratification or profit, often resulting in unjust, cruel and harmful treatment of the girl or boy. (Save the Children definition)\n"
"\n"
"2️⃣ **Know your organisation’s child safeguarding policies and referral procedures.**\n"
"\n"
"📖 All organisations should have or develop child rights safeguarding policies and referral procedures, including details on how to respond appropriately when a caregiver, other adults, girl or boy discloses abuse. \n"
"\n"
"📝 You should have accurate knowledge of all protocols and response plans. These will tell you what to do within your organisation if a caregiver or girl or boy reports abuse (e.g. who to report to, internal resources for supporting the girl or boy), as well as how to engage outside resources (e.g. local referral pathways, when to engage with authorities). \n"
"\n"
"🔑 It is your responsibility to act regardless of whether you are responding to disclosures of past and/or present abuse. However, you are not responsible for resolving the situation on your own. It is important that you discuss the situation with your supervisor to agree on what steps to take next.\n"
"\n"

"🌷Parents participating in your sessions need to know that they can come to you for help, regardless of when the abuse occurred. \n"

"If you’re creating audio or video files of yourself to upload, make sure that the audio or video message is as clear as possible – they don’t need to be professional, but they do need to communicate clearly!

You can model this process by sending a message that shares about how you are feeling today and describing where you are feeling it in your body, for example: “Today I am tired!

If they are struggling to contribute, ask them to share strategies that they have tried in their own homes. Make sure you take note of the solutions you would like to discuss further with the group.\n"

"\n"
"Closing the session is an opportunity to pull out the most important content from the session. Most importantly, closing the session is an opportunity to tell parents what they are doing right! Thank parents for sharing and remind them all how difficult it can be to try new things. Praise, praise, praise them for the work they are doing to make themselves and their families healthier and happier!"

"In some programmes, facilitators tell participants what to do and why it is important. Participants are used to this because many education systems are delivered in a didactic, teacher-knows-best manner. In the PLH programme, we do things differently. We like to think of this as a collaborative approach to learning. As facilitators, we are **collaborators or partners** working with parents to identify plans and practice solutions that will help them to improve life at home.\n"
"**It is helpful to think of the participants as the experts.**\n"
" \n"
"Many of the parents will already be practicing lots of positive ways of parenting with their children. Others will be able to identify ways of improving their parenting on their own with guidance. **Our job is to help parents learn for themselves how to achieve their goals.**\n"
"This sometimes means we have to work harder to ask the right sort of open-ended questions that will help participants work out the benefits of positive parenting and relationship building. **When participants are able to teach themselves on how to relate and behave, they learn a skill that will help them for a long time after the programme ends.**"

"The modelling principle is at the foundation of how we deliver the @global.prog_name. \n"
"If we lead sessions in a collaborative approach, praise parents often, practice active listening (by acknowledging messages), and use positive instructions, parents will do the same with their children. Likewise, if we tell parents what to do, criticize them, ignore their needs or concerns, or only say what we do not want them to do, they will do the same.\n"
"\n"
"Facilitators need to model of all the different Core Principles in this programme. \n"
"\n"
"For example, when you praise your participants, do not add any buts, ifs, or any other criticisms! Use transition warnings. Give positive, specific instructions that say the behaviour you want to see in the participants. Some behaviours may need to be addressed directly such as participants being offensive to an individual or the group.\n"

"Use praise to encourage participants to arrive on time for sessions, to complete their home activities, and when they accomplish something very challenging. Practice Taking a Pause to help reduce your own stress.\n"
