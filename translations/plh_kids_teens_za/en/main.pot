"👋 First, gather everything you’ll need - blankets, pillows, chairs, and maybe even a table. If you want to add a little magic, grab a light to light up your fort.\n"
"\n"
"🔷 Now, it’s time to build. Start by setting up two chairs facing each other, or use a table as the main structure of your fort. \n"
"\n"
"👋 Drape the blankets over the chairs or table to create a roof. Don’t forget to secure them - use clothing pegs or something heavy to hold everything in place so your fort stays strong!\n"
"\n"
"🔴 Next, make the inside extra comfy with pillows or blankets. \n"
"\n"
"🎈 Once your fort is built, add some fun touches. Ask your child to bring their favourite toys or books, and decorate the space however you like. \n"
"\n"
"📝 You could even make a “welcome” sign together to make it feel like your very own special house!\n"
"\n"
"🌙 Now, crawl inside and enjoy your new fort! This is your cosy, creative space for reading stories, playing games, or just spending some quiet time together.\n"
" \n"
"Building a blanket fort is more than just a fun activity - it’s a chance to spark creativity, solve problems, and share special moments together. So, grab those blankets and start building your adventure today! 💡"

"⏰ Help your teen break down their goal and set up smaller goals they need to achieve to reach their greater goal. \n"
"\n"
"📝 It is much easier to achieve a goal if you write it down! This way, you can be reminded of it as you work towards it.\n"
"\n"
"☀️ For example, if the goal is to be good at football, small weekly goals could be to go to football practice 2 times per week, run at least 1 km 5 times per week, and learn about the sport from other football players in the community or from books or videos they find. \n"
