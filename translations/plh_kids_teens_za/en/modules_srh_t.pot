"When I did this app together with my mother, I realised that so many things I learnt were not true. I learnt I can get better information and I learnt others should never push me to do things I do not want to do. My mother and I can talk about these things now. I wish we could have done that when I was younger, because it would have helped me a lot, but I am still glad we can talk today. Whenever I have a question or problem now, I know I can ask my mother and she will help me think of answers and solutions together."
